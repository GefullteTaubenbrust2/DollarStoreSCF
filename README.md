In the future, I plan to actually add Python scripting so you can properly use this like any other quantum chemistry software. That's a bit into the future, unfortunately. There's also no OpenMPI support or anything of the likes at the moment, the software mostly just serves as a learning tool for myself and possibly whoever stumbles upon it.
